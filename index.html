  <h1>Project Euler</h1>

  <h3>These are some (hopefully correct) responses to Project Euler problems found at the <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> site.</h3>
  <h3>Completing them is meant to be an exercise in building my mathematical knowledge and logical thinking skills.</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><p>1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
