    <li><p>2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br>

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>6.  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,<br>

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385<br>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,<br>

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025<br>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.<br>

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>

      <li><p>9. A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,<br>

          a2 + b2 = c2<br>
          For example, 3 squared + 4 squared = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5 squared.<br>

          There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. <br>
          Find the product abc.?</p>
